# Pacman-Game
ðŸŽ® Game Description for Your Pac-Man Clone
Navigate a maze full of pellets, walls, and dangerous ghosts in this classic arcade-style Pac-Man remake. Control Pac-Man using the arrow keys (or W/A/S/D) to collect all the food dots while avoiding the colored ghosts chasing you through the labyrinth. Each pellet you eat earns you points, and completing the maze takes you to the next level. Lose all your lives, and it's game over!
